# Description

*"Hell's Driver: The Definitive Driving Game"*

Get behind the wheel and unleash chaos on the streets! In *Hell's Driver*, running over is not only allowed... it's your mission! Face a world without rules, where pedestrians are points, enemy cars are obstacles, and the path to victory is through destruction. Do you dare to test your reflexes and your morals?

Drive like a maniac: Take control of your vehicle and race through the city infested with unsuspecting pedestrians. The more you run over, the more points you earn!
Drunk mode: Do you think you are brave? Take a drink and watch your ability distort. Drunk driving isn't easy, but the points are worth the risk.

No rules, just chaos: There are no limits. Crashing into pedestrians is part of the game. The only rule is to cause maximum chaos without losing your life.
Get ready for endless adrenaline! In *Hell's Driver*, the road is your battlefield. Smash, destroy and laugh while you do it!
